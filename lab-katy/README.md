#Cowsay Vanilla HTTP Server

hey there! if you've downloaded this app, and you want to make the cow talk, you'll need to type the command <npm i node cowsay> into your terminal.  
>From there, go ahead and type in the command <node server.js>. Your terminal should read 'server up: 3000'
>open up another tab in your terminal. 
  >to make a GET request, run the command http :3000/cowsay text=='whatever text you want'
  >to make a POST request, run the command http POST :3000/cowsay text=='whatever text you want'
>Enjoy watching the cow talk!
>NOTE: if you use a single = when running your commands, the server may get upset. Use == for best results.
